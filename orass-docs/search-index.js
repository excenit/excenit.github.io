to Excenit RSS. This documentation covers how to use all aspects of the system to generate and submit returns to BoG. Excenit RSS is an automated, end-to-end solution for managing returns. It interfaces directly with BoG’s ORASS API to retrieve pending returns, manage report generation including validation, approval of returns, submission to BoG and status updates of submitted returns. The documentation has two main parts - functional, which covers how to generate and submit returns to BoG, and technical, which covers how to manage the entire system. The functional documentation explains how to generate and submit returns. There five main tasks: Data loading Dava validation Report generation Report review Data analytics Each of these tasks is explained in detail in the documentation. The technical documentation explains how to manage the entire system.

There are two primary email systems: Internal with RSS using Microsoft Exchange SMTP By default, RSS uses orass@excenit.com, which is configured for Microsoft Exchange Online to manage all internal communications. However, this email system is controlled by Excenit and we strongly advice that you update the parameters in Azure if this is the preferred email system.

Dynamic analyses are most relevant on annexes that have multiple records, i.e., not summary data. Examples include MAFI 100, 200, 900, etc. To analyze a return: Open the return in edit mode and navigate to the annex. Switch to the Summary & Interactive Analysis tab. There are several types of charts available (Box 1) and analyses (Box 2). Select the type of chart (table, barchart, heatmap, etc.) and the type of analyses, including sum, average, sum over sum, etc. Select the variables for the analyses. The variables correspond to columns, are listed in Box 2. Select the summary variables from Box 3 and place them in either Box 4 or Box 5 depending on how you want the chart displayed. You can always switch column and rows using the arrows in Box 2. Suppose we are interested in the average Loan Amt.

All returns have the same structure. You can either load a single annexure (corresponding to a sheet in the Excel template from BoG) in a return or load the entire return. All returns have the same layout and features as shown below. Return List Browser (List of available returns). All returns that are due to BoG will be listed here and grouped according to status. Select a return to load its details to the right. There are five status codes: In Process - This means the return is ready for processing. BoG has created this return in its system and Excenit RSS has pulled the details from the BoG API. Data Loading - This means the data is being loaded. Typically, this status message is only possible when loading returns with a lot of records such as MAFI. Once the data load is complete, the status will change to either Data Loaded with Errors or Data Loaded. Data Loaded with Errors - This means the data load is complete but at least one record failed validation. Data Loaded - This means all data for the return were loaded and there are no errors or warnings to review. Report Generated - After the report has been generated (Microsoft Excel or XML). Pending CFO Review - The return has been submitted to the designated CFO for review. The CFO has yet to act on it. CFO Approved - CFO has reviewed and approved the return. The return will be submitted to BoG via the API within a fixed time, which is five minutes by default but can be changed by the Administrator. CFR Rejected - CFO has reviewed the return and rejected it. See the Review tab for optional notes from the CFO on what to correct. Submitted to BoG - The return has been transmitted to BoG after the CFO approved. At this point, there’s nothing else to do but wait for status updates from BoG. Excenit RSS polls the BoG API at periodic intervals for updated status. BoG Rejected - BoG has completed its validation and rejected the returns because of errors. In this state, the Report Manager can edit the return and fix the issues identified. BoG Accepted - BoG has completed its validation and there are no errors with the returns. The return is no longer editable unless unlocked by the CFO. The Report Manager can request unlock from the CFO. Return Metadata - This section is not editable and provides information about the return. It also includes the return in Microsoft Excel format for download. When the status of the return is In Process, the Excel file is usually empty, showing the blank template from BoG. The Return Status field is the same information as in 1. The Reference Code is the BoG code assigned to this return. Reporting Officer, CFO, As Of, Due Date, and Date Signed are all completed automatically by the system. If the Administrator has enabled data upload option, the Report Status field will also show an option to upload data. This feature is disabled by default and typically, not advisable. It is useful when the return has been prepared outside the Excenit RSS system, and you would want to use the API feature of Excenit RSS to submit to BoG. See the section on uploading returns for more information. Data Load Summary - This tab shows the summary of the validation of the returns. Click Open Error Report to see the error report of the return. See more details in the Validation section. Click Auto Refresh to automatically reload the validation summary at fixed intervals. The default is every 30 seconds. Click Stop Refresh to stop the auto-refresh. Review - This tab contains messages and notes from the CFO after review. Validation Summary - This page shows the summary of the validation. They are grouped by annex, Message Type (error or warning), Error Type, and the Column Name. Use the Slider to customize the available space. Slide to the right to increase the size of the Return List browser or to the left to reduce it. Double-click the arrow in the slide to fill the whole page with the details of the selected return. In this view a return is not editable. In order to edit a return, double-click it in the Return List browser to open in edit mode. Breadcrumb Navigation - This shows you where you are in relation to the list of returns. In the image above, we have loaded the MAFI return in edit mode. Annexure List (Sheets in Excel Template) - All the Sheets in the return will be listed here. For example, the return below shows all the tabs of the MAFI return. MAFI 100, highlighted in purple, has been selected and therefore the data have been loaded into the data pane (box 9). Data Tabs - Lists the sections of data in an annexure. For example, in the image below, MAFI 100 is titled \"Loans, Overdraft, and other Advances\", which is shown here. Interactive Analytics - Allows you to conduct quick analyses of the data using dynamic pivot tables. See more information in the \"Analytics\" section. Dashboard - Similar to box 4, this tab allows you to view quick analytic data using pre-designed templates. Actions - Use this tab to perform annexure-specific tasks such as loading data for only one Sheet instead of loading all the data for the return. Filter Bar - Use these buttons to filter the displayed data for the annexure by error status. By default, all records are shown. Select the Error option to display only records with errors. Similarly, the Warning option shows only records with warnings. Finally, the Valid option lists only records in the annexure that have no validation issues. Records Navigator - By default, the data pane shows only 1,000 records. Use the arrows in box 8 to navigate through the records. Contact the Administrator to change this value. However, loading more records than 1,000 at a time will increase data load time. Data Pane - This is where the records in the annexure are loaded. By default, only the most relevant columns, usually those required by BoG, are loaded. The records are color-coded. Red means they have errors and purple means they have warnings. Records not colored have no issues. Click on a colored record to view details of the error or warnings. See \"Validation\" for more details. Settings - Use this button to choose the columns in the annexure that will be displayed in box 9. Action Bar - Use the buttons in this bar to manage the return. Click to load the data for the entire return. By default, this action both loads and validates the data. Click to re-validate data. This is important if you manually edit the data after loading. Click to generate the Excel report after data loading. This only works if data has been loaded. Click to download the generated Excel return. Click to reset all the data on this return. Click to submit this return to CFO for approval. Click to save changes. Click to close without saving any changes. To load a return, log in as a user with Report Manager privileges. In the Return List browser, select the return to process. Double-click to open it in the Return Edit pane in edit mode. From the Action Bar, click the data load button. This will open a window with options: There are five options to consider. The default options are the most common. Only change if necessary. The most important, especially for long-running returns like MAFI, is the option to email the Report Manager when the data load and validation are complete. If you select \"No\", the data will still load in the background but there will be no notification. Click the proceed button to load the data or the cancel button return to terminate the process. If you proceed to load from the previous step, you will see the following screen, showing the change in status to Loading the data : If you click Refresh, the validation statistics will be updated as below: You will receive an email if you opted for one in step 3. Review the data by opening the return in edit mode. If a record contains errors or warnings, it will be color-coded: red for errors and purple for warnings. Sometimes it might be necessary to load data for a single annex instead of all the annexes. This approach is useful for re-loading data after errors or warnings have been addressed. To load the data for a single annex: Navigate to the annex in edit mode. Select the \"Actions\" tab. Click the data load button and follow the process. While not encouraged, there are times the loaded data must be edited. Examples include data that are not readily available in the core banking database. Excenit RSS allows selective editing in some circumstances, especially for annexes with summary data such as MAFI 500 or QAFI 100.","title":"Data Loading","component":"orass","version":"0.1","name":"data-loading","url":"/orass/0.1/functional/return-submission/data-loading.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Load a Return","hash":"_load_a_return","id":2},{"text":"Load Data for a Single Annex","hash":"_load_data_for_a_single_annex","id":3},{"text":"Edit Data","hash":"_edit_data","id":4}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"This section explains the Excenit RSS validation process in detail. Data validation is key to Excenit RSS. All values are validated against BoG rules. By default, data are validated during the data load process. However, data can be re-validated. Data loaded for returns must be re-validated to ensure compliance with BoG rules. After validation is complete (either as part of the data load process or separately), the results will be summarized in the \"Data Load\" tab of the return. Validation marks each record as either Valid, Warning, or Error. Records marked as Valid have passed the BoG rules for each column. If a record is marked as Warning then it means at least one of the columns has a warning. The same goes for Error markings. Records that fail validation (Error) will not be accepted by BoG. BoG rejects an entire return even if there’s a single error. Warnings on the other hand will not be rejected by BoG, but they require attention. Excenit RSS identifies five (5) types of validation, which are flagged as Error or Warning depending on the context. The validation types are: Decimal places - Shown when the number of decimal places exceed what BoG requires. If desired, the Administrator can set the system to round up all decimal values to 2 places. Otherwise, the records will be marked with Error. Invalid values - Shown when the values are different from what BoG expects for the field. For example, gender should be either Male or Female. Anything else would cause this type of issue. Missing - Shown when an expected value for a field is absent. Numeric sign - Shown the sign of a numeric value deviates from the BoG rule. For example, having a negative value instead of positive. This type of violation occurs typically with financial statements where the original data has negative sign but BoG’s template and formulas expect a positive number. Range - Shown when the value is outside the expected range. For example, in MAFI 100 if the Loan Disbursement Date is after the report As Of Date, a Range violation is reported. If you change the loaded data or make manual entries, it is important to re-validate the data to ensure compliance with BoG rules. To validate a return, click the in the Action Bar button to re-validate. All annexes in the return will be validated and the validation report updated. If you want to validate a single annex, navigate to that Action tab on that annex and click the validate button. Follow the following steps to review the validation report for a return. Open the return in either edit or view mode. Click Open Error Report. Filter - Use the items here to filter the validation report. Depending on the volume of data, there will be a lot of records and Excel limits the number of records per sheet to one million. You can filter by annex, message type, or validation type. The return is automatically selected and not editable. To filter the records, select an annex within the return. All errors and warnings will be automatically displayed in the data pane. You can further filter on Message Type values such as Error, Warning, or All to show both errors and warnings. You can also filter on the Validation Type. Each filtering selection is executed automatically. Export - Export the validation results from the data pane into Excel. Remember, Excel limits the number of records in a sheet to one million, so use as many filters as possible to limit the number of records. The Excel file will be downloaded into your browser’s default download folder. The exported data look exactly as appears in the data pane. The data page contains the filtered validation results. The last column, Message provides detailed explanation of the error. The Row # column points to the record in the staging or data warehouse where the data from the core banking environment or other sources are stored for loading.","title":"Data Validation","component":"orass","version":"0.1","name":"data-validation","url":"/orass/0.1/functional/return-submission/data-validation.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Validation Types","hash":"_validation_types","id":2},{"text":"Validate Data","hash":"_validate_data","id":3},{"text":"Review Validation Report","hash":"_review_validation_report","id":4}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Excenit RSS is a web-based solution that is generally intuitive and easy to use.

After generating the report, it is now time to submit for review. By default, a user with the Report Approver role is assigned to the return. If there are multiple users with the Report Approver role, one is selected at random. The Report Approver corresponds to the CFO/Representative section of the attestation form (AF100) of each return. Returns can be re-assigned to other approvers if the default one is unavailable. Contact the Administrator to re-assign returns. You can only submit a return whose status is Report Generated. Only users with the Report Manager role can prepare and submit a return for review. To submit a return for approval, open the return in edit mode. If you are not the original Report Manager who prepared this return, the system will prompt you to switch ownership. After switching ownership, close and re-open the return. Ensure that in the Metadata section, the Reporting Officer field has your name. In addition, the report name should be visible next to the Report field. If any of these conditions are violated, please contact your Administrator or regenerate the return. In the Action Bar click button to submit for approval. Confirm that you want to submit for approval. Confirmation means you are signing the attestation form (AF100) that is attached to the BoG template for this return. After confirmation, AF100 in the return will be populated with the name of the reporting officer and the current date. The selected CFO will be notified by email and the status of the return will change to Pending CFO Review. If a return is ready for review, the assigned CFO will receive an email after the Report Manager submits it. If the return was submitted but email wasn’t received, please contact the Administrator who will re-assign the return to expected approver. To review a return: Log in as a user with Report Approver role. By default, the users with Report Approver roles can not edit any other parts of the system. Go to Workflow→ My Task Queue → Pack Approval → CFO Reviews. The number of pending returns will be in parentheses. In the screenshot below, there is one pending return to be reviewed. Open it from the right pane by double-clicking. This screen is similar to the one used by the Report Manager to prepare the return, but the content cannot be edited by the Report Approver. There are four important sections of this screen. Metadata - Here you will find the report file (in Excel), the status of the return (Pending CFO Review), the Reporting Officer, the CFO, the As Of date, and the date the Reporting Officer signed the return. Ensure that all these fields have the correct values. If not, please contact the Administrator or the Report Manager to review and correct. Error Report - Click this link to open the detailed validation summary attached to this return. Review - Use this space to send a message to the Report Manager who prepared this return. Action Bar - Contains the buttons to approve, reject the return or close this window without any action. In the Metadata section, click the report file to download and review. After reviewing a return, you can approve or reject. To reject a return, go to the Review tab and provide feedback that will go back to the Report Manager. After that, click the Reject button in the Action Bar. The system will ask you to confirm rejection, after which the Report Manager will be notified via email and the status of the return will change to CFO Rejected. If a return is rejected, the Report Manager who prepared the return will receive a notification via email. The status of the return will change to CFO Rejected. You can only make changes to such a return before resubmitting. If the return has no issues, you can instead approve it.After approval, it will be submitted to BoG. Once you approve a return, it will be submitted to BoG, typically within five minutes. The only way to stop a return from going to BoG is if the Administrator stops the process within the allotted time. Sometimes it may be necessary to re-assign the approval of a return to someone else. Only the Administrator can do this. To re-assign a return: Log in as a user with administrative privileges. Go to Workflow→_User Tasks_. This will open the screen below. Go to the Filter box to select the parameters, including the process. Click Apply. The list of processes that have been submitted for approval and meet the criteria above will be displayed. Select the task you want to re-assign.
