to Excenit RSS. This documentation covers how to use all aspects of the system to generate and submit returns to BoG. Excenit RSS is an automated, end-to-end solution for managing returns. It interfaces directly with BoG’s ORASS API to retrieve pending returns, manage report generation including validation, approval of returns, submission to BoG and status updates of submitted returns. The documentation has two main parts - functional, which covers how to generate and submit returns to BoG, and technical, which covers how to manage the entire system. The functional documentation explains how to generate and submit returns. There five main tasks: Data loading Dava validation Report generation Report review Data analytics Each of these tasks is explained in detail in the documentation. The technical documentation explains how to manage the entire system.

In addition, local administrators can make changes without calling in support. Most configurations are located under the System menu, and they cover settings such as institution information, API credentials, email options, scheduled tasks, security including password complexity, auditing, report loading options, enable single-sign on with Azure AD integration, and many others. Getting Around Application Properties You can easily navigate around the properties by going to System → Application Properties and typing the property of interest in the search box. Changes to the configuration parameters affect the entire system. Please ensure you have reviewed all materials on this page completely before making any changes. When in doubt, reach out to Excenit RSS support as support@excenit.com. During setup, you will provide information about your financial institution. These data are also available in the returns. If you don’t provide them, they will be populated using the first returns that are retrieved from BoG’s ORASS API. To update the institution information, a user with the default orass-system-admin role (or equivalent) would follow the steps below: Go to System in the menu bar to the left. Click Application Properties to open the configuration page. In the Search by property name field at the top of the page, type in institution, which will show the list of options. Edit the three key fields as necessary. These should be obtained from the Bank of Ghana ORASS system. Change the API credentials under the API authentication node on the Application Properties page. excenit → orass → api → settings Update the username and password with the machine id credentials from ORASS. Any other credential would not work. To test that the credentials are working, go to the Scheduled Tasks menu and execute Get Pending Returns task. For more information on how to execute tasks, see the Scheduled Tasks section below on this page. Similarly, update the API url in the url node. This configuration is useful when BoG’s endpoint changes or returns need to be submitted to the test system. The default values resolve to the production ORASS API. Excenit RSS uses email to notify uses about various system events and statuses. There are two primary email systems: Internal with RSS using Microsoft Exchange SMTP configuration By default, RSS uses orass@excenit.com, which is configured for Microsoft Exchange Online to manage all internal communications. However, this email system is controlled by Excenit and we strongly advice that you update the parameters in Azure if this is the preferred email system. Only one email system can be used at any time.You must set the default email engine in Application Properties.The default system is Microsoft Exchange using the orass@excenit.com email address. To use the Microsoft Exchange as the default email system: Navigate the engine property in the options node. Select MICROSOFT_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY in the Current Value field and click OK to save. If you use the default configuration connect to orass@excenit.com, there is nothing else to do.However, if you need to use your organization’s Azure Active Directory, settings you need to configure additional settings in the next step. Navigate to the excenit→auth→microsoft node and provide the configuration parameters for your organizations. These are advanced configurations, and they should match exactly what is available in Azure. The settings in this node are also used for the Single-Sign On feature. To configure email using the SMTP settings, navigate to the excenit→`email` node. The most important parameters are: excenit.email.smtpHost excenit.email.smtpPassword excenit.email.smtpPort excenit.email.smtpUser The values to these properties must point to a valid SMTP configuration. Excenit RSS uses scheduled tasks to execute several tasks. Several tasks have been pre-configured to retrieve new and available returns from the ORASS API, submit new returns, check the status of submitted returns, load data from sources, including core banking application into the staging database/warehouse. These tasks have been configured to run at specific intervals. These intervals can be changed. Familiarity with the Unix cron jobs system is assumed. Tasks can also be executed manually, and new tasks can be added. However, adding new tasks is a highly specialized function that the Excenit RSS support team will provide. All pre-configured tasks are disabled by default. They must be activated to run at the specified times or intervals. Tasks must be activated in order to execute at specified intervals. Once a task is active, it is uneditable until deactivated. To execute a task, ensure it is activated. To activate a task, just select it and click the Activate button (in red box). Upon activation the Active box will be checked.Once the task is active, it will run at the specified time/intervals. Default tasks use a cron expression to specify the run times. Periodic intervals can also be used to execute tasks. Tasks can also be executed immediately by clicking the Execute button (blue box). To edit a task, click the Edit button (green box) to open the editor. To edit the run times for a task, use the Cron Expression text box (red box) to input the cron command. Click the help icon for more help on how to write cron expressions. You can also configure tasks to execute periodically (Period) or with a fixed delay (Fixed Delay) (green box). All three options yield the same results. With the Period and Fixed Delay options, you must specify the period to execute the task in seconds. Remember to save all changes and reactivate task after edits. Syntactically incorrect expressions might lead to unexpected results. Be sure to validate all new expressions or use the template provided. Caution Edit pre-configured scheduled tasks with care. They might be inoperable without Excenit RSS support. The next few sections describe some of the key pre-configured tasks that are necessary for the effective functioning of Excenit RSS. New returns from the ORASS API are managed by the getPendingReturns method. By default, it is scheduled to execute every day between 8 am and 9pm at the top of the hour. To update the time, edit the task and specify a new time. This default configuration is sufficient for most financial institutions, but it can be changed based on the types of returns that need to be submitted.When new returns are created the user with the orass-report-manager role will receive an email notification. When a return has been approved by the CFO (or the user assigned the orass-report-approver role) approves a return, this task, submitPendingReturns picks it up and submits to BoG through the ORASS API. By default, it executes every five minutes. The task will notify both the assigned orass-report-approver and the orass-report-manager who prepared the return by email. The notification will report the status of the submission as either Accepted by BoG or Rejected by BoG. When a return status is Accepted by BoG it only means the transmission was successful and waiting review and approval by BoG. After a return transmission has been accepted by the ORASS API, the updateSubmittedReturns task continuously checks with the ORASS API for a change in status. When the status changes, the task will notify the approving orass-report-approver and the orass-report-manager. This task also executes every five minutes and can be configured as necessary. The resetReturns task restores all returns to their original state and assumes that no return has been submitted. This task should be used sparingly, perhaps with Excenit RSS Support team to reset the system. Improper use can cause system instability. The populateXXXXXSourceData tasks are used to load data from source into the staging environment. Like all other tasks, it can be configured to run at specific intervals. When executed this task: identifies returns with PROCESS_INITIATED status, checks the staging database/warehouse for data with the submission period that matches the report date of the return, loads any data from the source environments, including core banking Be cautious when editing pre-configured tasks. They can have unexpected consequences, including non-submission of returns or retrieval of new returns. Excenit RSS offers several security options, which are configurable in Application Properties and elsewhere. The default login mechanism for Excenit RSS is system-specific username and password. In addition to that, RSS can be integrated with Azure AD or any LDAP system for credential management. Integration with Azure AD is pre-configured, which means you will only need to update specific properties to use it. By default, single-sign on with Azure AD is disabled. Before enabling SSO, ensure that you have updated the properties in the microsoft node. See Microsoft Exchange. To enable SSO with Azure AD, search for the useSSO property and set the value to YES. When SSO is enabled, users can log in with their Azure AD username and password, most likely email address and password. Users will still need to be assigned the appropriate roles before they log in. This means users can’t log in unless they’ve been added to the list of approved users. There are several configurable report options. These can be found under the excenit→orass→return node on the Application Properties page. There are several configurable options for the ETL. The default configuration is typically sufficient for loading and preparing returns. The etl and advanced nodes excenit→orass→system→options→advanced allows for the configuration of various ETL parameters. Other ETL configuration parameters are located in the parent node options. The parameter names are self-explanatory There are many more configurable options in Application Properties, and they all follow the same format as described above. They have very descriptive names.","title":"Setup & Configuration","component":"orass-documentation","version":"0.1","name":"setup-and-configuration","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/setup-and-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Update Basic Configuration","hash":"_update_basic_configuration","id":1},{"text":"Institution Information","hash":"_institution_information","id":2},{"text":"API Configuration","hash":"_api_configuration","id":3},{"text":"Email System","hash":"_email_system","id":4},{"text":"Microsoft Exchange","hash":"_microsoft_exchange","id":5},{"text":"SMTP Server","hash":"_smtp_server","id":6},{"text":"Scheduled Tasks","hash":"_scheduled_tasks","id":7},{"text":"Executing Tasks","hash":"_executing_tasks","id":8},{"text":"New Returns","hash":"_new_returns","id":9},{"text":"Submit Returns","hash":"_submit_returns","id":10},{"text":"Update Return Status","hash":"_update_return_status","id":11},{"text":"Reset Returns","hash":"_reset_returns","id":12},{"text":"Data Loading","hash":"_data_loading","id":13},{"text":"Security","hash":"_security","id":14},{"text":"Single Sign-On (SSO)","hash":"_single_sign_on_sso","id":15},{"text":"Report Options","hash":"_report_options","id":16},{"text":"ETL Options","hash":"_etl_options","id":17},{"text":"Backup Options","hash":"_backup_options","id":18},{"text":"Other Settings","hash":"_other_settings","id":19}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"If your license includes access to the optional complaints component, this page provides a detailed guide on how to manage the record complaint incidents.

All returns have the same structure. You can either load a single report (corresponding to a sheet in the Excel template from BoG) in a return or load the entire return. All returns have the same layout and features as shown below. Return List Browser (List of available returns). All returns that are due to BoG will be listed here and grouped according to status. Select a return to load its details to the right. There are five status codes: In Process - This means the return is ready for processing. BoG has created this return in its system and Excenit RSS has pulled the details from the BoG API. Data Loading - This means the data is being loaded. Typically, this status message is only possible when loading returns with a lot of records such as MAFI. Once the data load is complete, the status will change to either Data Loaded with Errors or Data Loaded. Data Loaded with Errors - This means the data load is complete but at least one record failed validation. Data Loaded - This means all data for the return were loaded and there are no errors or warnings to review. Report Generated - After the report has been generated (Microsoft Excel or XML). Pending CFO Review - The return has been submitted to the designated CFO for review. The CFO has yet to act on it. CFO Approved - CFO has reviewed and approved the return. The return will be submitted to BoG via the API within a fixed time, which is five minutes by default but can be changed by the Administrator. CFR Rejected - CFO has reviewed the return and rejected it. See the Review tab for optional notes from the CFO on what to correct. Submitted to BoG - The return has been transmitted to BoG after the CFO approved. At this point, there’s nothing else to do but wait for status updates from BoG. Excenit RSS polls the BoG API at periodic intervals for updated status. BoG Rejected - BoG has completed its validation and rejected the returns because of errors. In this state, the Report Manager can edit the return and fix the issues identified. BoG Accepted - BoG has completed its validation and there are no errors with the returns. The return is no longer editable unless unlocked by the CFO. The Report Manager can request unlock from the CFO. Return Metadata - This section is not editable and provides information about the return. It also includes the return in Microsoft Excel format for download. When the status of the return is In Process, the Excel file is usually empty, showing the blank template from BoG. The Return Status field is the same information as in 1. The Reference Code is the BoG code assigned to this return. Reporting Officer, CFO, As Of, Due Date, and Date Signed are all completed automatically by the system. If the Administrator has enabled data upload option, the Report Status field will also show an option to upload data. This feature is disabled by default and typically, not advisable. It is useful when the return has been prepared outside the Excenit RSS system, and you would want to use the API feature of Excenit RSS to submit to BoG. See the section on uploading returns for more information. Data Load Summary - This tab shows the summary of the validation of the returns. Click Open Error Report to see the error report of the return. See more details in the Validation section. Click Auto Refresh to automatically reload the validation summary at fixed intervals. The default is every 30 seconds. Click Stop Refresh to stop the auto-refresh. Review - This tab contains messages and notes from the CFO after review. Validation Summary - This page shows the summary of the validation. They are grouped by report, Message Type (error or warning), Error Type, and the Column Name. Use the Slider to customize the available space. Slide to the right to increase the size of the Return List browser or to the left to reduce it. Double-click the arrow in the slide to fill the whole page with the details of the selected return. In this view a return is not editable. In order to edit a return, double-click it in the Return List browser to open in edit mode. Breadcrumb Navigation - This shows you where you are in relation to the list of returns. In the image above, we have loaded the MAFI return in edit mode. Report List (Sheets in Excel Template) - All the Sheets in the return will be listed here. For example, the return below shows all the tabs of the MAFI return. MAFI 100, highlighted in purple, has been selected and therefore the data have been loaded into the data pane (box 9). Data Tabs - Lists the sections of data in a sheet/report . For example, in the image below, MAFI 100 is titled \"Loans, Overdraft, and other Advances\", which is shown here. Interactive Analytics - Allows you to conduct quick analyses of the data using dynamic pivot tables. See more information in the \"Analytics\" section. Dashboard - Similar to box 4, this tab allows you to view quick analytic data using pre-designed templates. Actions - Use this tab to perform report-specific tasks such as loading data for only one Sheet instead of loading all the data for the return. Filter Bar - Use these buttons to filter the displayed data for the sheet/report by error status. By default, all records are shown. Select the Error option to display only records with errors. Similarly, the Warning option shows only records with warnings. Finally, the Valid option lists only records in the reports that have no validation issues. Records Navigator - By default, the data pane shows only 1,000 records. Use the arrows in box 8 to navigate through the records. Contact the Administrator to change this value. However, loading more records than 1,000 at a time will increase data load time. The default records to be displayed can be modified in the . Data Pane - This is where the records in the report are loaded. By default, only the most relevant columns, usually those required by BoG, are loaded. The records are color-coded. Red means they have errors and purple means they have warnings. Records not colored have no issues. Click on a colored record to view details of the error or warnings. See \"Validation\" for more details. Settings - Use this button to choose the columns in the report that will be displayed in box 9. Action Bar - Use the buttons in this bar to manage the return. Click to load the data for the entire return. By default, this action both loads and validates the data. Click to re-validate data. This is important if you manually edit the data after loading. Click to generate the Excel report after data loading. This only works if data has been loaded. Click to download the generated Excel return. Click to reset all the data on this return. Click to submit this return to CFO for approval. Click to save changes. Click to close without saving any changes. To load a return, log in as a user with Report Manager privileges. In the Return List browser, select the return to process. Double-click to open it in the Return Edit pane in edit mode. From the Action Bar, click the data load button. This will open a window with options: There are five options to consider. The default options are the most common. Only change if necessary. The most important, especially for long-running returns like MAFI, is the option to email the Report Manager when the data load and validation are complete. If you select \"No\", the data will still load in the background but there will be no notification. Click the proceed button to load the data or the cancel button return to terminate the process. If you proceed to load from the previous step, you will see the following screen, showing the change in status to Loading the data : If you click Refresh, the validation statistics will be updated as below: You will receive an email if you opted for one in step 3. Review the data by opening the return in edit mode. If a record contains errors or warnings, it will be color-coded: red for errors and purple for warnings. Sometimes it might be necessary to load data for a single report instead of the entire pack. This approach is useful for re-loading data after errors or warnings have been addressed. To load the data for a single report: Navigate to the report/sheet in edit mode. Select the \"Actions\" tab. Click the data load button and follow the process. While not encouraged, there are times the loaded data must be edited. Examples include data that are not readily available in the core banking database. Excenit RSS allows selective editing in some circumstances, especially for reports with summary data such as MAFI 500 or QAFI 100. When editing is enabled, new records can either be inserted or loaded data on the screen can be modified. All data edits are logged when audit logging is enabled. To insert a record on a report with editing enabled: Navigate to the report. In the example below, we want to insert records for MAFI 500 — Details of Non-Current Assets Held for Sale, which aren’t available in a standard way. If a report has multiple sections, there will likely be tabs within the report. Click the Add button to insert a new record, which will add a new empty row. Type in the data for the record and save. You can add additional rows before or after saving. If enabled, automatic validation will be triggered to ensure the new data would meet ORASS requirements. Optional. Inserted data can be edited or deleted. Save the pack when complete and manually initiate validation if desired. To edit an existing data: Navigate to a report that permits editing. Double-click the field to edit. Save the record and save the pack. Validate if necessary. Some Excenit RSS license options allow for the import of data directly into the software for validation and submission to the ORASS API. There are two ways to import data directly into the application: Customized Report Import - import data for specific reports only. Global Import - import entire return, including all reports/sheets and Currently, Excenit RSS allows customized report import on selected reports within a return. Using this feature requires the data to be provided in a format specified by Excenit RSS. Typically, customized imports are enabled for reports for which the data are unlikely to reside in the core banking application. To import data into a sheet: Identify the template for the report of interest. This is available in the Templates page. Navigate to a return that allows bulk import, e.g., MAFI 1000 Locate the Import button on the tab. Upload the data A user with orass-system-admin privileges must enable data import in Application Properties before use. When global import is enabled, the import button is available for the entire pack. When it is not enabled, the Report Metadata section shows the attached report template, which can be downloaded. After import is enabled, the Upload Data button is enabled. To import an entire pack: Click the Upload Data button and navigate to the file. Global import only works with the BoG template for the select pack. Select the file you want to upload. Depending on the size of the file the next screen might take a while to load since the file must be loaded into memory. On the Confirmation screen choose an import option: Import and replace — the final return to BoG will use the file that was uploaded. Import — only the data will be imported and the standard templates will be used to generate the returns. All the data in the file will be extracted and inserted into Excenit RSS. In addition, they will be validated for accuracy. When complete, you can proceed to examine data, review error log, or submit for approval.","title":"Data Loading","component":"orass-documentation","version":"0.1","name":"data-loading","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/data-loading.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Load a Return","hash":"_load_a_return","id":2},{"text":"Load Data for a Single Report (Excel Sheet)","hash":"_load_data_for_a_single_report_excel_sheet","id":3},{"text":"Edit Data","hash":"_edit_data","id":4},{"text":"Data Import","hash":"_data_import","id":5},{"text":"Customized Report Import","hash":"_customized_report_import","id":6},{"text":"Global Import","hash":"_global_import","id":7}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"This section explains the Excenit RSS validation process in detail. Data validation is key to Excenit RSS. All values are validated against BoG rules. By default, data are validated during the data load process. However, data can be re-validated. Data loaded for returns must be re-validated to ensure compliance with BoG rules. After validation is complete (either as part of the data load process or separately), the results will be summarized in the \"Data Load\" tab of the return. Validation marks each record as either Valid, Warning, or Error. Records marked as Valid have passed the BoG rules for each column. If a record is marked as Warning then it means at least one of the columns has a warning. The same goes for Error markings. Records that fail validation (Error) will not be accepted by BoG. BoG rejects an entire return even if there’s a single error. Warnings on the other hand will not be rejected by BoG, but they require attention. Excenit RSS identifies five (5) types of validation, which are flagged as Error or Warning depending on the context. The validation types are: Decimal places - Shown when the number of decimal places exceed what BoG requires. If desired, the Administrator can set the system to round up all decimal values to 2 places. Otherwise, the records will be marked with Error. Invalid values - Shown when the values are different from what BoG expects for the field. For example, gender should be either Male or Female. Anything else would cause this type of issue. Missing - Shown when an expected value for a field is absent. Numeric sign - Shown the sign of a numeric value deviates from the BoG rule. For example, having a negative value instead of positive. This type of violation occurs typically with financial statements where the original data has negative sign but BoG’s template and formulas expect a positive number. Range - Shown when the value is outside the expected range. For example, in MAFI 100 if the Loan Disbursement Date is after the report As Of Date, a Range violation is reported. If you change the loaded data or make manual entries, it is important to re-validate the data to ensure compliance with BoG rules. To validate a return, click the in the Action Bar button to re-validate. All annexes in the return will be validated and the validation report updated. If you want to validate a single annex, navigate to that Action tab on that annex and click the validate button. Follow the following steps to review the validation report for a return. Open the return in either edit or view mode. Click Open Error Report. Filter - Use the items here to filter the validation report. Depending on the volume of data, there will be a lot of records and Excel limits the number of records per sheet to one million. You can filter by annex, message type, or validation type. The return is automatically selected and not editable. To filter the records, select an annex within the return. All errors and warnings will be automatically displayed in the data pane. You can further filter on Message Type values such as Error, Warning, or All to show both errors and warnings. You can also filter on the Validation Type. Each filtering selection is executed automatically. Export - Export the validation results from the data pane into Excel. Remember, Excel limits the number of records in a sheet to one million, so use as many filters as possible to limit the number of records. The Excel file will be downloaded into your browser’s default download folder. The exported data look exactly as appears in the data pane. The data page contains the filtered validation results.

After generating the report, it is now time to submit for review. By default, a user with the Report Approver role is assigned to the return. If there are multiple users with the Report Approver role, one is selected at random. The Report Approver corresponds to the CFO/Representative section of the attestation form (AF100) of each return. Returns can be re-assigned to other approvers if the default one is unavailable. Contact the Administrator to re-assign returns. You can only submit a return whose status is Report Generated. Only users with the Report Manager role can prepare and submit a return for review. To submit a return for approval, open the return in edit mode. If you are not the original Report Manager who prepared this return, the system will prompt you to switch ownership. After switching ownership, close and re-open the return.

Metadata - Here you will find the report file (in Excel), the status of the return (Pending CFO Review), the Reporting Officer, the CFO, the As Of date, and the date the Reporting Officer signed the return. Ensure that all these fields have the correct values. If not, please contact the Administrator or the Report Manager to review and correct. Error Report - Click this link to open the detailed validation summary attached to this return. Review - Use this space to send a message to the Report Manager who prepared this return. Action Bar - Contains the buttons to approve, reject the return or close this window without any action. In the Metadata section, click the report file to download and review. After reviewing a return, you can approve or reject. To reject a return, go to the Review tab and provide feedback that will go back to the Report Manager. After that, click the Reject button in the Action Bar. The system will ask you to confirm rejection, after which the Report Manager will be notified via email and the status of the return will change to CFO Rejected. If a return is rejected, the Report Manager who prepared the return will receive a notification via email. The status of the return will change to CFO Rejected. You can only make changes to such a return before resubmitting. If the return has no issues, you can instead approve it.After approval, it will be submitted to BoG. Once you approve a return, it will be submitted to BoG, typically within five minutes. The only way to stop a return from going to BoG is if the Administrator stops the process within the allotted time. Sometimes it may be necessary to re-assign the approval of a return to someone else. Only the Administrator can do this. To re-assign a return: Log in as a user with administrative privileges. Go to Workflow→User Tasks. This will open the screen below. Go to the Filter box to select the parameters, including the process. Click Apply. The list of processes that have been submitted for approval and meet the criteria above will be displayed. Select the task you want to re-assign. Click the Reassign task button, which will open the Task reassignment window. Select the new assignee and click OK. The new assignee can now log in and the task will be available under Workflow→ My Task Queue.

Each of these functions are mapped to specific user roles.RSS includes three default roles that map to these functions. Report Manager - orass-report-manager CFO - orass-report-approver Admin - orass-system-admin Other roles can be created as necessary. RSS uses a very fine-grained permission system. This means that permissions can be granted at the table, column, and even row levels. In addition, users can be given permissions to various sections of the screen. The default Report Manager role controls all Submission Packs(\"packs\"). RSS also included pre-configured roles for other packs, including: MAFI (orass-mafi-report-manager), MFBK (orass-mfbk-report-manager), etc. The pre-configured roles follow the naming convention — orass-XYZK-report-manager, where XYZK is the code identifier for the pack. In addition, there are other specialized pre-configured roles, including orass-data-loader, who can manage data loading or API. Remember all these roles can be modified and new ones created. There are pre-configured to ensure RSS works out-of-the box. Excenit RSS uses system-defined users or other directory protocol systems such as Microsoft Azure AD, or LDAP. Users from an external system such as Microsoft Azure AD must To create a user: Navigate to Security→Users. Click Create to add a new user. Enter the user information. Required fields are highlighted in red. You can enforce password change at next logon by checking the Change Password at Next Logon box. Assign the role to the user by clicking Add' in the `Roles section. See User Roles for more details on the types of roles available. A user can have multiple roles. However, the most permissive role will take precedence. Select the roles you want to assign the user from the list below. Press Ctrl on your keyboard to select and assign multiple roles. You can impose additional security requirements on a user by restricting the IPs from which they can connect to the RSS system. You can use email as the username to minimize forgotten username/password. Filter the list roles by typing in the first few characters in the Name field. If a desired role isn’t available at the time of creating the user, one can be created by clicking the Create button. Similarly, existing roles can be modified by clicking the Edit button or create a new role by copying an existing one. Once a user is created, a notification will be sent to the email address created in the previous step. If password change is required, they must do so in accordance with the password complexity rules defined in Application Properties. You can examine the \"effective role\" of a user, i.e., the resources a user can access. This is useful when troubleshooting access adn permission issues. To examine the effective role of a user, select the user from the Users screen and click the Additional button. In the example above, the user Daniel Adoko has access to specific screens including Returns but has no access to the Dashboard, Workflow and System. Additional permissions or restrictions, which are not in the roles assigned to this user can be granted/imposed. For example, even though the user has access to the MAFI returns, for business reasons, this user isn’t permitted to download the returns. This restriction can be imposed through the UI tab of the Effective Role screen. Excenit RSS provides a unique feature known as Access Groups, which allow users to be segregated manner. Consider a hypothetical bank, Ghana Freedom Bank Inc. that has multiple divisions responsible for specific reports with their own CFO and the data must only be visible to members of that division. With Excenit RSS, we can create an Access Group that corresponds to the daily forex returns. Returns created and submitted to BoG will only be visible to members of that group, in addition to all other assigned roles as described in User Roles. The Access Group can also be used to capture data from other sources that are outside the core banking system but are needed for preparing reports, or subsidiaries that are separate entities but must supply data for reporting. By default, all users are created under the Company group. Other groups can be created for several use-cases, include those outlined above. In addition to creating groups, uses can be moved across groups with simple clicks, specific constraints and restrictions can be defined for uses.","title":"User Management","component":"orass-documentation","version":"0.1","name":"user-management","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/security-management/user-management.html","titles":[{"text":"User Roles","hash":"_user_roles","id":1},{"text":"Required Functional Roles","hash":"_required_functional_roles","id":2},{"text":"Default and Pre-configured Roles","hash":"_default_and_pre_configured_roles","id":3},{"text":"Create User","hash":"_create_user","id":4},{"text":"Manage User Roles","hash":"_manage_user_roles","id":5},{"text":"Advanced System Access","hash":"_advanced_system_access","id":6}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"","title":"Application Database","component":"orass-documentation","version":"0.1","name":"application-database","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/application-database.html","titles":[]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Excenit RSS is a web application, which means it primarily executes in a browser.

On this page, we provide an overview of the salient features of the system and the requirements for effective implementation and operation. Excenit RSS is an end-to-end solution that manages all aspects of the return submission, including extracting the data from the core banking application database (and other sources), validating the data to meet BoG rules, formatting the data to conform to BoG requirements, generating the final returns, and submitting the returns directly to the ORASS API. In addition, Excenit RSS includes analytic tools – interactive dashboards and pivot tables – for reviewing data and measuring performance, a set of workflow tools for reviewing returns, and a secure system for ensuring that only authorized persons can access and use the system. Table 1 shows the minimum hardware and software requirements to for Excenit RSS. The table includes the requirements for three environments – the RSS application server, the staging database, and the end user. These requirements can be exceeded to improve performance. Table 1.

The final environment is configurable and revolves the seven key processes outlined in Figure 1. RSS comprises six key systems and servers as shown in Figure 2: Core Banking Application Database — this is the primary data source, which will contain data needed for returns. Other Systems — systems that contain other information including human resources, accounting (if not using the core banking application), flat files, among others. RSS Staging Database — a database that holds data extracted from the core banking application database and other source systems. RSS Application Database –- a database that holds final data for returns. RSS Application Server — an Apache Tomcat server, which hosts the application and manages the entire process. BoG ORASS API — the source for information on returns and submission of pending returns. These systems connect to each other to create a fully functional Excenit RSS system. The servers identified in Figure 2 need not be physical computers. A virtualized environment provides similar performance. In addition, while not encouraged, some systems can share resources. For example, the RSS database can be located on the application server. RSS has several key modules, which are loosely-coupled yet, provide a seamless end-to-end automation experience. The main modules are: ETL process Data loading/report preparation Data validation Return generation Return submission API Workflow Analytics Messaging Security These modules together provide the complete automated return submission experience from Excenit. A key feature of the Excenit RSS is building an ETL process to automate data collection from various sources. The ETL process is central to Excenit RSS and typically requires the most effort. The ETL process maps the data elements from primary sources to the BoG format. The primary source is the core banking database. We recognize that not all data elements required for the ORASS returns reside in the core banking application, therefore during development, we collaborate with owners of key systems to identify and prepare data from other sources. The ETL preparation process includes: Developing parameterized queries to connect to data sources. The parameterized query ensures that RSS can extract only the data needed for a return. For example, for January 2022 MAFI returns, the end date which is defined in the BoG ORASS system as 31st January 2022, will be passed as a parameter to the query, ensuring that only data for that period are extracted from the source system into the staging database. Developing queries with internal data extraction rule and criteria. To match the format specified by BoG, Excenit collaborates with the report owners (typically the Finance and technology teams) to identify business rules to map data from source to BoG formats. Testing results of queries frequently and thoroughly to ensure that all returns are accurate. When returns are due to BoG, officers can either load the returns manually (with a single click) or configure returns to execute automatically (without human intervention) when due. RSS loads data by triggering the ETL to retrieve data from the core banking system database to the staging database, matching BoG’s data template which is then loaded to the application. RSS allows a manual file for upload either a whole return pack or individual sheets in the return pack. On some returns, users can edit values that have been loaded. However, it is important that the returns are re-validated whenever there are manual edits to the data. By default, manual edits to returns Validation is a key feature of Excenit RSS, which includes all BoG specified rules for data elements through a custom rules engine, which is updated to reflect changes to BoG specifications when necessary. Excenit implements validation during the ETL development and during return loading. Excenit RSS validates data for each field in each record against BoG validation rules in the data loading process, provides a detailed validation report for errors and warnings review, it does this for individual sheets in a return type, validation report can also be downloaded in an Excel format. During the initial ETL development, Excenit collaborates extensively with the client team to correct problems identified during validation. Data cleaning is a major task that requires significant resources from the client. Excenit encourages clients to clean data from source, although it is possible to make corrections in the staging environment. Subject to contractual requirements, Excenit can assist with data cleaning. Excenit RSS populates the BoG return templates (Microsoft Excel or XML) with data that validated. Reports generated and submitted for approval. Upon approval, RSS submits returns to BoG as scheduled. The system administrator configures the frequency, it can wait for a defined time set to send report to BoG. Rejected returns must be revalidated and regenerated. RSS monitors BoG’s API for status changes to submitted returns. It must be noted that current limitations with BoG’s API means errors and warnings in returns must be retrieved manually from the ORASS portal. The deployment process ensures that the likelihood of rejection is eliminated. Excenit RSS is tightly integrated with BoG’s ORASS API. This means all return parameters are retrieved from the API. Specifically, Excenit RSS Periodically connect to BoG’s ORASS API to retrieve pending returns, Uses information on pending returns to initiate the ETL process (optional), Notifies relevant users of pending returns, Submits approved returns to BoG, and Updates status of return using data from BoG’s ORASS API. Excenit RSS includes a customizable workflow engine to ensure all returns are approved by appropriate authorities before submission to BoG. By design, no return is submitted without approval. The RSS API only flags a return for submission after approval. The workflow also ensures that, returns that have been submitted to BoG are locked to prevent unauthorized edits. The workflow ensures that the status of each return is tracked and updated from when the returns are due to BoG up to submission. The Excenit RSS workflow implements other controls over returns. For example, when a return is pending BoG approval, they cannot be edited. If a return needs to be resubmitted, the CFO or an authorized representative will have to explicitly unlock it for edits to be made. At a minimum, RSS requires three (3) users with distinct roles to have it fully functioning. RSS comes predefined with the role rules which can easily be assigned to a user once created: Administrator: Configures RSS out of box, has full unrestricted access to RSS. Report Manager: Loads data, review data, review validation report, generates report and submits report for approval. CFO: Reviews data, can also review validation report, download a generated report, approve or decline report, dashboard access for activities on returns, pass comments on a report. Excenit RSS includes built-in tools to analyze return data, particularly for MAFI and MBK returns. The analytic tools include interactive dashboards and interactive pivot tables, which users can use to generate summaries from the data. Specifically, RSS comes out of the box with inbuilt interactive analytical and dashboard tools. RSS provides executives with dashboards for activities on return, like return due date and return submission date, and other parameters that might be useful for executive decision-making, including key performance indicators. Dashboards and analytic tools are customizable to meet specific client needs. At every stage of the return submission process, Excenit RSS notifies users about the status of the returns and other activities. For example, when new returns are due to BoG, the responsible officers will be notified. Similarly, during return processing, approvers are notified when returns have been prepared and due for review and approval. To enhance RSS workflow processes, RSS allow mailing configuration like private internal SMTP parameters to be used or a public SMTP server. An email is sent to the appropriate identity in the workflow process for every core RSS functionality triggered. Excenit RSS follows strict data governance protocol to ensure that data is safe, secure and free from manipulation. The following are key security elements of Excenit RSS: Restricted User Access – Access to Excenit RSS is role-based and fine-grained, which means application administrators can restrict user access to only the parts of the software they need. Tamper-proof Audit Log – Excenit RSS logs all user-changes to return data loaded from the staging database into the RSS database. Secured Data Transmission – Excenit RSS is a web application, which is deployed with industry standard security. All communications are encrypted via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. Excenit RSS includes an automated backup and recovery tools that ensure point in time recovery (PITR) of the application database. In addition, completed returns, which are by default saved to the application server are backed up to an external location and the application database. To recap, the application database contains completed returns, data for generating returns, and system configuration settings.","title":"System Overview & Features","component":"orass-documentation","version":"0.1","name":"system-overview","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/system-overview.html","titles":[{"text":"System Requirements","hash":"_system_requirements","id":1},{"text":"Basic Architecture","hash":"_basic_architecture","id":2},{"text":"Key RSS Features","hash":"_key_rss_features","id":3},{"text":"Extract, Transform, and Load with Data Mapping","hash":"_extract_transform_and_load_with_data_mapping","id":4},{"text":"Data Loading/Report Preparation","hash":"_data_loadingreport_preparation","id":5},{"text":"Data Validation","hash":"_data_validation","id":6},{"text":"Report Generation","hash":"_report_generation","id":7},{"text":"Return Submission","hash":"_return_submission","id":8},{"text":"API","hash":"_api","id":9},{"text":"Workflow","hash":"_workflow","id":10},{"text":"Analytics","hash":"_analytics","id":11},{"text":"Messaging","hash":"_messaging","id":12},{"text":"Security","hash":"_security","id":13},{"text":"Business Continuity","hash":"_business_continuity","id":14}]}},"components":{},"componentVersions":{"orass-documentation/0.1":{"displayVersion":"0.1","title":"Excenit RSS (Orass) Documentation","version":"0.1","name":"orass-documentation","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"Orass Documentation","site-url":"https://docs.excenitapps.com","source-language":"asciidoc@","imagesdir":"modules/functional/images","table-caption":"Table"},"sourcemap":false},"url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/index.html","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"Introduction","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/index.html","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":0},{"items":[{"content":"Functional","items":[{"content":"Return Preparation and Submission","items":[{"content":"Quick Tour","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/quick-tour.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Data Loading","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/data-loading.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Data Validation","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/data-validation.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Analytics","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/analytics.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Report Generation","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/report-generation.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Workflow","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/return-submission/workflow.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Security Management","items":[{"content":"Audit Logs","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/security-management/audit-logs.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"User Management","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/security-management/user-management.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Other","items":[{"content":"Complaints","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/functional/others/complaints.html","urlType":"internal"}]}]}],"root":true,"order":1},{"items":[{"content":"Technical","items":[{"content":"System Overview and Architecture","items":[{"content":"System Overview and Features","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/system-overview.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"RSS Architecture","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/rss-architecture.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Application Database","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/application-database.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Application Server","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/application-server.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Staging Database","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/system-overview-and-architecture/staging-database.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Setup And Configuration","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/setup-and-configuration.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"Appendix 1: Properties Reference List","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/appendix-01.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Backup &amp; Recovery","url":"/orass-documentation/0.1/technical/backup-and-recovery.html","urlType":"internal"}]}],"root":true,"order":2}]}}}})
